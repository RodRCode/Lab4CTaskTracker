/*
 * You have been hired by a firm to provide a console-based prototype of a task tracking application. Based on product owner requirements, spend the next few days implementing a task tracking application.
   
Things to do so far:
    Need to figure out how to manipulate highlighted text on the console
    (stretch) get string commands for up arrows, down arrows and such.
    Do I need to rewrite the console text every time?
    highlight text
    strike through text
    read and write to data file
    How to keep track of data file and if an item has been actioned or deleted or pushed off to the future
    move between pages on the screen (15 items at a go)
    I am thinking the pointer to use is the one that has a pointer at the head and tail of the string to go to the next and previous items
